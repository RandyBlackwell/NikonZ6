        <h1>Nikon Z6 Mirrorless Camera</h1>
        <p id="para1">The Nikon Z6 is a full-frame mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera produced by Nikon. The camera was officially announced on August 23, 2018. Nikon began shipping the Z6 to retailers on November 16, 2018. This was the second camera to use Nikon's new Z-mount system after the release of the 45.75 megapixel Nikon Z7 in September 2018.</p>
        <p id="para2">
This more-affordable 24.5 megapixel full-frame model offers nearly all of the same specifications as the Z7. Aside from the lower resolution, differences include fewer phase-detection autofocus points (273 compared to 493) and an added anti-aliasing filter. The fewer megapixels allow for some benefits: a higher ISO equivalent, faster 12fps (vs. 9fps) drive speed, greater burst depth and the ability to capture oversampled 4K video in full-frame (not only with APS-C crop) recording.</p>
        <p id="para3">
Three Z-mount lenses were available by December 2018, the Nikkor Z 24-70mm f/4 S FX AF, the 35mm f/1.8 S FX AF and the 50mm f/1.8 S FX AF. The F-to-Z mount adapter accessory allows for using Nikon lenses from the digital SLR series with full compatibility. In late 2018, Nikon also published a "roadmap" of lenses to be released between 2019 and 2021. A total of nine products were included in that list.</p>
